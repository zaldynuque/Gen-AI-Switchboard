1. How many rows are there?

2. How many different columns are there in the dataset? What are the names of these columns?

3. Are there any missing values in the dataset?

4. Can you display a brief summary of the columns in the dataset for me?

5. Generate a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plot of obesity among people with / without Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Label the axes, add a legend, and comment on the main trends.

6. Show the distribution of age of people with respect to Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Label the axes, and comment on the principal trend observed.

7. Plot a correlation heatmap, showing correlations among all the columns. Label the axes, and highlight the standout trends.

8. Validate the following hypothesis using a T-test. Null Hypothesis: Higher levels of obesity do not increase the risk of CHD. Alternate Hypothesis: Higher levels of obesity increase the risk of CHD.

9. Follow these steps to run a Logistic Regression model to predict the CHD variable:\
1. Clean the dataset so it has no null values.\
2. Preprocess the dataset so it is ready for use by a Logistic Regression model.\
3. Run Logistic Regression to classify people into 1 (with CHD) or 0 (without CHD) with the following steps:\
3a. Split the data into Train and Test sets. These datasets should not contain the CHD column.\
3b. Train the model on the Train dataset. Make sure the model converges, so use as many iterations as necessary for that.\
3c. Obtain y_pred by predicting on X_test and use a threshold to convert y_pred into binary values.\
3d. Plot the Confusion Matrix, print the accuracy score between binary y_pred and y_test, and comment on the predictive performance of the model.

10. Follow these steps to run a Binary Classification model of your choice from a list of options such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines to predict the CHD variable:\
1. Clean the dataset so it has no null values.\
2. Preprocess the dataset so it is ready for use by the Binary Classification models.\
3. Run Binary Classification to classify people into 1 (with CHD) or 0 (without CHD) with the following steps:\
3a. Split the data into Train and Test sets. These datasets should not contain the CHD column.\
3b. Train the model on the Train dataset. Make sure the model converges, so use as many iterations as necessary for that.\
3c. Obtain y_pred by predicting on X_test and use a threshold to convert y_pred into binary values.\
3d. Plot the Confusion Matrix, print the accuracy score between binary y_pred and y_test, and comment on the predictive performance of the model.\
4. Compare the performance of each model, pick the best performing model and provide reasoning for why the model was selected.

11. Follow these steps to run a Binary Classification Neural Network to predict the CHD variable:\
1. Clean the dataset so it has no null values.\
2. Preprocess the dataset so it is ready for use by a Binary Classification Neural Network.\
3. Run Binary Classification to classify people into 1 (with CHD) or 0 (without CHD) with the following steps:\
3a. Define the model architecture:\
3.a.1. Three hidden layers with ReLU as activation function.\
3.a.2. Dropout = 0.5.\
3.a.3. Optimizer = adam.\
3.a.4. Loss = binary_crossentropy.\
3.a.5. Metrics = [accuracy].\
3.a.6. Epochs = 30.\
3.a.7. Batch Size = 32.\
3b. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (80% training, 10% validation, 10% test). These datasets should not contain the CHD column.\
3c. Train the model on the Train dataset. Make sure the model converges, so use as many iterations as necessary for that.\
3d. Predict the model on the Test dataset to see how the binary classification Neural Network generalized on unseen data.\
3d. Obtain y_pred by predicting on X_test and use a threshold to convert y_pred into binary values.\
3e. Plot the Confusion Matrix, print the accuracy score between binary y_pred and y_test, and comment on the predictive performance of the model.
